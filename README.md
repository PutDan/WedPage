# Daniel and Patricia's wedding homepage.

Our minimalistic, beautiful, internationalized and (mostly) responsive wedding page hosted on aws. To see the final result, visit: [daniel-patricia.us](http://www.daniel-patricia.us).

Built just as a playground for gaining some frontend design + vue framework experience.

Featuring:

* [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
* [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
* [vue-tslint](https://github.com/zhanba/vue-tslint)
* [bootstap-vue](https://github.com/bootstrap-vue/bootstrap-vue)

You might be able to fork this and adjust it to your own needs. No guarantees on it working.

# Getting Started

* ```git clone https://github.com/PutDan/WedPage.git```
